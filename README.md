Last night room was very close, single sheet over me seemed inch thick— Bug proof windows seems to repel obtrusiveness on the part of any prowling **Zephyr** that might want to come in and lunch on perspiration. Rolled like a ship in a Typhoon, if this weather keeps on I'll wear holes in the bed clothes. Arose early■Weather blasphemingly hot— went out in sun, came back dripping with water, tried to get into the umbrella rack to drain off, took off two courses of clothes This would be a good day to adopt **Sidney Smiths** plan of taking off your flesh and sitting down in your bones. Mem—go to a print cloth mill and have yourself run through the calico printing machine. This would be the **Ultama Thule** of thin clothing. Read some in **Lavatar, Mm Recamier, Rosseaus Emilé**.
